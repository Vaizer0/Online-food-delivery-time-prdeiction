# Online Food Delivery Time Prediction

## Final Model Performance

### Conclusion

1. **Influential Factor: Rating of Delivery Person**
   - The rating of the delivery person from previous deliveries proves to be the most significant factor affecting the delivery time of food to the destination.
   - Delivery persons with higher ratings tend to deliver food in less time compared to those with lower ratings.

2. **Model Performance Metrics:**
   - The final model achieves an RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) score of 7.28, indicating that the average error between predicted delivery time and the actual delivery time is 7.28 minutes.

### Recommendation

1. **Maintaining High Ratings:**
   - The rating received by the delivery person reflects their performance in delivering food promptly.
   - Consistent low ratings may lead to a potential loss of customers. It is crucial to maintain good delivery time performance to uphold high ratings and retain customer trust.

2. **Customer Assurance:**
   - The RMSE value serves as a guarantee of delivery time performance.
   - Communicate the RMSE score to customers as a commitment to ensuring that delivery times do not exceed the given RMSE score, translating to a delay of not more than 7.28 minutes.
